Exploring the stability and resilience of the IEEE 39 bus  power system under disturbances.
This project explores the stability and resilience of the IEEE 39 bus power system 
under disturbances. We begin with a load flow analysis using the Newton-Raphson 
method to confirm system stability. Next, we examine the frequency response to the 
outage of a major generator, including the impact of different load frequency relief 
settings. We calculate the Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI) for each bus to identify 
weaker points and design a load-shedding scheme that prioritizes these areas to 
enhance stability. This study highlights the importance of integrated analysis and 
control strategies for reliable power system performance.
